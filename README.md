## C++:

### SQLite-Library for C++:
In this part of the course we build a library for simplefying the use of SQLite with modern C++. 
It taught me a lot about How templates work and why/when to use them. It also helpt me to get a better understanding of pointers. 
The actual library is in the SQLite.h file that depends on the Handle.h file. I used the sqlite_1.cpp file to test parts of my code.

### Boost Projects:
In the boost projects I discovert some useful parts and libraries of the Boost C++ Libraries. like:
- any
- project_options
- filesysten
- signals2

### Class-Assignment:
In this project I had to create a base class and 3 inheriting classes information in a table.

### OOP-Assignment:
In this assignment I had to create a class from information from what schould be in the class.

### Difficult-Challenges:
In this Project I had to work with C++ concepts like: Pointers, &Operators, multiple classes, inheritance, polymorphism and exeptions.

### Harder-Challenges:
This prodject uses C++ concepts like: Math functions, conditional statments, while and do while loop, for loops, arrays and reference variables.

### Simple-Challenges:
In this project I worked  the very basic C++ concepts like: in\output, vasiables, constants and strings.

### Operators-Challenges
This is a project where I explored the moste common C++ operators.

## Unreal Engine:

### Cross The Road
In this challange we had to build a simple quick game using C++ and blueprints. I took my inspiration from cross the road games.

### Pong:
In this project I learned how tu use C++ and blueprints together to create a pong game. we used C++ to create base classes and, 
blueprints that derive from those classes to add functionality. 

### Blueprint-Fundamentals:
In this project I learned how to use blueprints to add functionality to a game. for example to create interactable objects.

### Fundamentals:
In this project i discovert the basics of the Unreal Engine. Things like: camera, lighting, materials, built-in physics, animation, partical effects,
basic player movment, basic AI movment and sound.
